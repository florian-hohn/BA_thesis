    abstract="Concept drift is a change of the underlying data distribution which occurs especially with streaming data. Besides other challenges in the field of streaming data classification, concept drift should be addressed to obtain reliable predictions. The Robust Soft Learning Vector Quantization has already shown good performance in traditional settings and is modified in this work to handle streaming data. Further, momentum-based stochastic gradient descent is applied to tackle concept drift passively due to increased learning capabilities. The proposed work is tested against common benchmark algorithms and streaming data in the field.",
